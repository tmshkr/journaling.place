Create 10 new tagged journal prompts with a response stub. Use the same JSON format as the following example:

```JSON
[
  {
    "prompt": "This is a journal prompt.",
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"],
    "stub": "This is a stub to a sample response..."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "This is another journal prompt.",
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3", "tag4", "tag5"],
    "stub": "This is a stub to a sample response..."
  }
]
```
